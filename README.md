# DAOggregate

## Description

Decentralized organizations, or DAOs, are a new approach to use blockchain technology to transparently run entire organizations more efficiently.

With so many new DAOs  emerging with its own set of goals, governance structures, assets under management, and incentive systems, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of them all.
DAOggregate is a tool that not only indexes the democratic internet but all provides the public with resources to create and educate themselves on DAOs.
